- [x] modify the quickbrush obsidian plugin just a bit: have them set a single directory to save to ("Quickbrush" by default) and use Quickbrush/quickbrush-images and Quickbrush/quickbrush-gallery accordingly). Also, every time you update the gallery, make sure Quickbrush/quickbrush-generations.base exists and if it doesn't, create it with this content (with the file.folder set according to the settings).
