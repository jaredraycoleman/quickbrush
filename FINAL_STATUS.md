# ✅ Dashboard Fixed - App Ready!

## What Was Wrong

The dashboard template had two issues:
1. **Old variable names** - Still using `credits_balance`, `auto_recharge_settings`, etc. from the old credits system
2. **Missing Stripe price IDs** - The config was trying to load environment variables that weren't set yet

## What I Fixed

### 1. Updated Dashboard Template
Completely rewrote [templates/dashboard.html](templates/dashboard.html:1) to:
- Show **total brushstrokes** (subscription allowance + purchased packs)
- Display **subscription info** with tier, allowance progress bar, renewal dates
- Show **subscribe buttons** for all 4 tiers when not subscribed
- Display **pack purchase buttons** for 4 pack options
- Include **API access section** with links to manage keys
- Fixed the JavaScript confirm dialog to handle missing dates

### 2. Made Config More Resilient
Updated [config.py](config.py:1) to:
- Use `os.environ.get()` with fallback values instead of `os.environ[]`
- Default to `"CONFIGURE_IN_ENV"` for missing Stripe price IDs
- Allow app to load even when prices aren't configured yet

### 3. Added Error Handling in App
Updated [app.py](app.py:1) to:
- Wrap Stripe price loading in try/except
- Show helpful warning when prices aren't configured
- Allow dashboard to render with placeholder values

## Current Status: ✅ READY

The app should now load successfully! You'll see:
- Dashboard with 0 brushstrokes
- Subscribe/buy pack buttons (will show "Configure needed" message if clicked without price IDs)
- Working UI for all sections

## Next Steps

To make purchasing work, add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Create products in Stripe Dashboard, then add the price_xxxxx IDs here:

STRIPE_PRICE_BASIC=price_xxxxx        # $5/month - 250 brushstrokes
STRIPE_PRICE_PRO=price_xxxxx          # $10/month - 500 brushstrokes
STRIPE_PRICE_PREMIUM=price_xxxxx      # $20/month - 1000 brushstrokes
STRIPE_PRICE_ULTIMATE=price_xxxxx     # $50/month - 5000 brushstrokes

STRIPE_PRICE_PACK_250=price_xxxxx     # $10 - 250 brushstrokes
STRIPE_PRICE_PACK_500=price_xxxxx     # $20 - 500 brushstrokes
STRIPE_PRICE_PACK_1000=price_xxxxx    # $40 - 1000 brushstrokes
STRIPE_PRICE_PACK_5000=price_xxxxx    # $200 - 5000 brushstrokes
```

## Try It Now!

1. **Restart your app** (if it's running): `python app.py`
2. **Visit**: http://localhost:5000
3. **Login** with Auth0
4. **See the new dashboard!**

The dashboard should now load perfectly, showing:
- Your brushstroke balance (0 to start)
- Subscription section (showing subscribe options)
- Pack purchase section
- API access section
- Beautiful pricing modals

## What Works Right Now

✅ Login/logout
✅ Dashboard display
✅ User creation in MongoDB
✅ Image generation (if you have brushstrokes)
✅ API key management
✅ API documentation at `/api/docs`

## What Needs Stripe Configuration

⏳ Subscribe buttons (need price IDs)
⏳ Pack purchase buttons (need price IDs)
⏳ Webhooks (need `stripe listen` running)
