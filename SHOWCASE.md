# Quickbrush: AI Art for Your TTRPG Adventures

Transform your tabletop RPG experience with **Quickbrush** - the AI-powered art generator designed specifically for game masters and players who need consistent, high-quality fantasy artwork on demand.

## Why Quickbrush?

### ðŸŽ¨ Consistent Fantasy Style

Unlike generic AI art tools, Quickbrush generates images in a cohesive fantasy RPG aesthetic. Every piece of art maintains the same visual style, ensuring your characters, items, and scenes feel like they belong in the same world.

### ðŸŽ­ Character Consistency with Reference Images

Create a character once, then generate them in any pose, outfit, or situation you need:

- Upload a reference image of your character
- Generate new art showing them in different armor
- Place them in various settings and scenarios
- Keep their appearance consistent across your entire campaign

### âš¡ Seamless TTRPG Integration

Quickbrush isn't just another web tool - it integrates directly into the platforms you already use:

- **FoundryVTT Module**: Generate art without leaving your game
- **Obsidian Plugin**: Create images directly from your campaign notes *(pending approval)*
- **REST API**: Build your own integrations
