      <h5 class="fw-bold text-primary">Our Mission</h5>
      <p class="mb-0">
        Quickbrush exists to <strong>enhance</strong> tabletop RPG experiences, not to replace professional artists.
        We believe AI art tools should complement human creativity, not compete with it. This page outlines
        our ethical approach and commitment to the artistic community.

  <!-- What We Are NOT -->
  <div class="card border-0 shadow-sm mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="fw-bold">‚ùå What Quickbrush Is NOT</h5>
      <p>We want to be crystal clear about what we're <em>not</em> trying to do:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Not a replacement for professional artists</strong> - We cannot and do not want to replace the skill, vision, and artistry of human creators</li>
        <li><strong>Not for commercial art sales</strong> - Our service is explicitly restricted from being used to sell AI-generated art as products</li>
        <li><strong>Not for plagiarizing artists</strong> - We actively prevent style mimicry and artist name usage in prompts</li>
        <li><strong>Not for professional publications</strong> - Commercial use requires written permission and appropriate licensing</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- What We ARE -->
  <div class="card border-0 shadow-sm mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="fw-bold">‚úÖ What Quickbrush IS</h5>
      <p>Our tool serves specific, ethical use cases where professional art wouldn't typically be commissioned:</p>

      <h6 class="mt-3">1. Quick Visualization for Home Games</h6>
      <p>
        <em>"Your party enters a misty forest glade with ancient stone ruins..."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Game masters often need quick visual aids during sessions. Hiring an artist for every encounter, NPC, or location
        is impractical for home games. Quickbrush fills this gap without competing with professional commissions.
      </p>

      <h6 class="mt-3">2. Character Iteration & Variants</h6>
      <p>
        <em>"What would my character look like in different armor? With a cloak? Holding a different weapon?"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Players love seeing different versions of their characters. These quick variants help players visualize options
        without commissioning multiple pieces from artists.
      </p>

      <h6 class="mt-3">3. Homebrew Content Visualization</h6>
      <p>
        <em>"I created a custom magic item / monster / location for my campaign..."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating custom RPG content often benefits from quick visual references. These aren't meant for publication
        or sale‚Äîjust personal campaign enhancement.
      </p>

      <h6 class="mt-3">4. Concept Exploration & Prototyping</h6>
      <p>
        <em>"I have an idea for a character but need to see different concepts before commissioning art..."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes seeing rough concepts helps clarify what you want. Use Quickbrush to explore ideas, then commission
        a professional artist for your final, polished artwork.

    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="fw-bold">üõ°Ô∏è Our Ethical Safeguards</h5>
      <p>We've implemented several protections to ensure ethical AI use:</p>

      <h6 class="mt-3">1. Prompt Sanitization & Artist Protection</h6>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No artist name mimicry:</strong> We actively filter and block prompts containing artist names or "in the style of [Artist]"</li>
        <li><strong>Generic style language:</strong> Our prompting uses artistic terms not tied to specific artists</li>
        <li><strong>Automated filtering:</strong> Our system sanitizes all user inputs to prevent plagiaristic prompting</li>
      </ul>

      <h6 class="mt-3">2. Non-Commercial Use Restrictions</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Generated images are licensed for <strong>personal use only</strong> by default</li>
        <li>Commercial use requires explicit written permission and appropriate licensing</li>
        <li>We prohibit selling generated images as standalone art products</li>
      </ul>

      <h6 class="mt-3">3. Transparent AI Disclosure</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>All images are clearly AI-generated - we never pretend they're human-created</li>
        <li>We're upfront about our technology stack (OpenAI DALL-E)</li>
        <li>We provide clear terms about usage rights and limitations</li>

      <h5 class="fw-bold">üåç The Bigger Picture: AI & Creativity</h5>

      <p>
        We recognize that AI art generation is a complex, evolving topic with legitimate concerns
        from the artistic community. Here's our stance:
      </p>

      <h6 class="mt-3">What We Believe</h6>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Artists deserve fair compensation</strong> for their work and expertise</li>
        <li><strong>AI should augment, not replace</strong> human creativity</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency is essential</strong> - users should know when they're viewing AI-generated content</li>
        <li><strong>Context matters</strong> - AI art for personal D&D games is different from commercial publishing</li>
        <li><strong>Human artists bring irreplaceable value</strong> through vision, emotion, and artistic interpretation</li>
      </ul>

      <h6 class="mt-3">Our Ongoing Commitment</h6>
      <p>
        As AI technology evolves, we commit to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Continuing dialogue with the artistic community</li>
        <li>Updating our policies to address emerging concerns</li>
        <li>Being transparent about our technology and its limitations</li>
        <li>Never positioning AI as a "replacement" for human creativity</li>
